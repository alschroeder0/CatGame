SOURCE DESCRIPTION
The Cat Game project is a program for a gacha-like game and fighting game with cats.
This program is a Java/JavaFX project developed using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
This project is not an executable file. The entire zip folder should be downloaded
and extracted before use.
Program should be run in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE or similarly functioning IDE. The
Main.java file should be the file that is built and run.


REQUIREMENTS
This project requires Java 12 and JavaFX 11. Earlier versions of these are not
guaranteed to function correctly or build properly.


ORGANIZATION
The Cat class is created in its own .java file. The module-info.java file is used
to set up functionality for JavaFX. All other relevant code is handled in the
Main.java file. It is organized by initializations and image imports, defining
the layouts for each scene, objects for the title screen, objects for the battle
screen, objects for the cat screen, and setting up the stage.


LIBRARIES
JavaFX libraries are imported to handle the structure of the Application. All
	class-level implementations of JavaFX Application objects are from the
	library. The use of these objects, including building the Application
	through scenes and stages, was done by the team.
Java.io libraries are imported to handle Input Streams and the FileNotFound
	exception. The use of the input stream objects was performed by the team.


KNOWN BUGS
There are currently no known bugs. Bugs can be reported to development team.
